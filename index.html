        <div class="body-text">
            <p>The first paper has been collected. The initial wave of relief has washed over you, lasting exactly as long as it takes to walk out of the testing hall. Exam season, after all, operates much like a badly structured financial instrument: it demands heavily front-loaded stress while deferring the coupon of relief to a date that feels perpetually out of reach.</p>

            <h3>The illusion of completion</h3>
            <p>Finishing one exam only to remember there are more is a peculiar breed of disappointment. It is rather like clearing a significant debt, only to recall that your portfolio of obligations remains aggressively diversified. You have, almost certainly, already run the post-mortem in your head. You have audited your answers, questioned your memory, and imagined disastrous outcomes. This mental accounting is entirely useless, which practically guarantees you will continue to do it anyway. The brain is not a rational actor.</p>

            <h3>The blackout period</h3>
            <p>Now begins the waiting period — that uncomfortable gap between performance and results. In the corporate world, this is known as the blackout period before quarterly earnings. You have done the work, the numbers exist on a desk somewhere, but you are barred from accessing them. The exam is over. The performance is logged. Now comes the tedious part: waiting for someone else to assign it a number.</p>

            <p>You will likely check the portal for results even though you know they haven’t been posted yet. This is normal. This is human. It is also incredibly annoying. Belief is immaterial at this stage. The paper is submitted. The only thing left is patience, which is in notoriously short supply during exam season.</p>

            <h3>Risk management</h3>
            <p>Managing exams while managing life is rather like trying to rebalance a portfolio during a market crash — technically possible, deeply unpleasant, and largely a matter of damage control. There is no way to hedge against exam stress. You cannot diversify away from the sheer, unvarnished reality of having to sit in a quiet room and perform.</p>

            <p>The only viable strategy is to show up, adequately capitalised with knowledge, and hope the market conditions — or in this case, the questions — align with your preparation. You did that. That is the entirety of your remit. That is all anyone can do.</p>

            <h3>The underlying asset</h3>
            <p>To momentarily abandon the metaphor: you are doing something genuinely difficult. You are managing an unreasonable workload while also attempting to exist as a person, which is demanding enough on its own. You showed up. You tried.</p>

            <p>It is easy to assign outsized importance to these moments, but the exam is merely a single data point in a vastly more complex dataset. Your fundamental worth is not traded on this exchange.</p>

            <h3>Forward guidance</h3>
            <p>There is another one coming. This is the unfortunate reality of exam season — it functions as a rolling debt facility, a marathon brutally structured as a series of sprints. It is perfectly acceptable to be exhausted by this. You are tired, and you have every statistical right to be.</p>

            <p>But you have also already cleared the first hurdle. You know the mechanics. You have proof of concept. The exams will eventually end. The results will be published. Life will stubbornly continue. And you will remain exactly who you are: someone demonstrably capable of handling hard things, even when they insist on arriving in clusters.</p>
