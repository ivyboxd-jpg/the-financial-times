        <!-- ARTICLE BODY -->
        <div class="article-body">
            <p>There is a specific, hollow sound that accompanies the closing of an examination booklet. It is the acoustic equivalent of a margin call being met: immediate relief, followed instantly by the realization that you have significantly less liquidity—in this case, serotonin—than you did three hours ago. The first exam of the season is finished. The paper has been collected by an invigilator who looked suspiciously like they would rather be anywhere else. You have walked out of the hall.</p>

            <p>The tragedy of this moment is that it feels like a conclusion, yet structurally, it is merely the end of the first quarter. The fiscal year is not over. The market remains open.</p>

            <h3>The illusion of completion</h3>

            <p>There is a peculiar disappointment in finishing an exam only to remember there are others standing in the queue, like creditors waiting for a payout. It is akin to clearing a significant debt, only to check your balance sheet and recall that your portfolio of obligations is, unfortunately, well-diversified. </p>

            <p>The brain, a helpful but occasionally malicious organ, will now attempt a forensic audit of the last three hours. You will remember the question you answered perfectly. You will gloss over this. Instead, you will focus with laser-like intensity on the four-mark sub-question where you may have misinterpreted the word "evaluate." This post-mortem analysis is statistically useless. The paper is gone. The transaction is settled. Yet, we replay the tape, searching for efficiencies in a factory that has already closed for the day.</p>

            <h3>The waiting period</h3>

            <p>We enter now the period of liquidity lag. This is the gap between performance and recognition, similar to the quiet period before earnings are released. You have done the work. The data exists. But the market (the examiners) has not yet priced it in.</p>

            <p>The anxiety of this waiting period is a feature, not a bug, of the academic system. You will feel the urge to check for results, even though you know, rationally, that they cannot possibly be ready. This is the same impulse that drives day traders to refresh charts on a Saturday morning. Logic has very little to do with it. Waiting is an act of passive endurance, and high-performers generally detest passivity.</p>

            <h3>Risk management</h3>

            <p>One cannot truly hedge against exam stress. There are no derivatives to purchase that offset the risk of a difficult question paper. The only available strategy is to show up, fully capitalized with hours of study, and hope the market conditions (the questions) align with your assets (your memory).</p>

            <p>You did this. You executed the strategy. You managed the risk. Managing exams while managing the rest of life is rather like trying to rebalance a portfolio during a market crash—technically possible, deeply unpleasant, and largely a matter of damage control. The fact that you did not liquidate your entire position in a panic is, in itself, a success.</p>

            <h3>The fundamentals</h3>

            <p>Let us briefly suspend the macroeconomic metaphors. The reality is simple and stubborn: You are doing something difficult. You are tired. The relief of finishing one paper is dampened by the looming spectre of the next. </p>

            <p>But consider the fundamentals. You walked in. You wrote. You walked out. In the grand dataset of your life, this exam is a single point on a very long chart. It may feel like a crash, or a boom, but zoomed out over a decade, it will look like a minor fluctuation. Your worth is not traded on this exchange. It is a fixed asset, independent of today's volatility.</p>

            <h3>The next quarter</h3>

            <p>There is another one coming. This is the rude reality of the season—it is a marathon structured deceptively as a series of sprints. It is exhausting. Admitting that does not make you weak; it makes you observant.</p>

            <p>The books will open again. The revision will continue. But for tonight, the market is closed. The exam is done. The performance is logged. Now comes the tedious part: waiting for someone else to assign it a number. While they do that, you remain exactly who you are—someone capable of handling hard things, even when they arrive in clusters.</p>
